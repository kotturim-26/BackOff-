BackOff!!!Mobile â€“ Sleep Monitoring App

BackOff!!!Mobile is a Swift-based iOS and watchOS application designed to monitor and improve sleep posture for individuals with sleep apnea. The app collects sleep data using Arduino-connected pressure sensors, displays real-time analytics through interactive charts, and provides Apple Watch haptic feedback to gently guide users off their back when necessary.
